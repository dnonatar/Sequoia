    A t-SNE perplexity generally has a value between 5 and 50. The visualization can be different depending on the value.
    The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors each point would have. 
    Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity. This following site is a good resource if you would like to dig deeper.

    A learning rate controls the gradient updates step size. A default value of around 200 generally works well. A larger dataset may 
    need a larger learning rate.

    A radius basically controls how large the circle size on the plot would be. If there are many points to display, a smaller radius 
    would make it easier to look at.
